# IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning

Welcome to the **IPL Score Prediction** project!  
This repository features a **Google Colab notebook** and an **IPL dataset (2008‚Äì2017)** designed to predict live IPL match scores using **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

Predicting IPL scores in real-time is challenging due to the large and complex data involved. Traditional models often struggle to identify hidden patterns.  
Here, **deep learning** steps in ‚Äî learning from historical player and team performances to predict match outcomes with higher accuracy.

This project leverages various machine learning and deep learning methods to build a robust **live IPL score prediction model**.
