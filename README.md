#IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning
Welcome to the IPL Score Prediction project!
This repository features a Google Colab notebook and an IPL dataset (2008–2017) containing match scores, designed to predict live IPL match scores using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
Project Overview
Predicting IPL scores in real-time is challenging due to the vast amount of data and dynamic match conditions. Traditional methods struggle to spot hidden patterns, but deep learning models excel by learning complex relationships from historical data.
This project uses past player and team performances to train models capable of predicting match scores with enhanced accuracy.
